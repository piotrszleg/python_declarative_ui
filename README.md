# Python UI annotation

Allows for creating user interfaces using class declarations and attributes.

Currently it uses tkinter as user interface implementation.

Created as an experiment with meta-programming in Python an inspired by Unity3D's component inspector generation.

# Running
Pass `example.py` to your Python 3 interpreter.
